# You're a great surgeon

Everybody knows it.
It's something about the way you walk into a room.
But if we wanted to make you _even better_, what should we measure?

Most cataract audits emphasize complications.
Since you don't have any of those, there isn't much benefit.
In addition, many audit tools report refractive outcomes using crude histograms, averages, and spherical equivalents.

But _you_ are a great surgeon, so you understand that most averaging results in lost information, and that spherical equivalents are meaningless.
A patient with a refraction of _&minus;0.50_ and a patient with a refraction of _&plus;0.50 / &minus;2.00 &times; 180Â°_ have the same spherical equivalent, but only one of them is happy.

We want all of your patients to be happy, but first, we need data.
That data needs to focus on refractive outcomes, and it needs to emphasize astigmatism.
More importantly, we need a community that can provide context for that data&mdash;something concrete to benchmark against.
But how can we build a community, when everyone is intimidated by your incredible outcomes?
We build that community by giving surgeons the ability to privately and anonymously compare their results to the group.
