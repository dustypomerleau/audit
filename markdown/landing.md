# You're a great surgeon

Everybody knows it.
It's something about the way you walk into a room.
But if we wanted to make you _even better_, what should we measure?
At the end of the day, it mostly comes down to cylinder.

Most cataract audit tools are far too focused on complications.
Since you don't have any of those, they don't benefit you much.
In addition, most tools report refractive outcomes with far too much averaging and emphasis on spherical equivalents.

But _you_ are a great surgeon, so you understand that all that averaging results in lost information, and that spherical equivalents are basically meaningless.
A patient with a refraction of _&minus;0.50 DS_, and a patient with a refraction of _&plus;0.50 / &minus;2.00 &times; 180Â°_ have the same spherical equivalent, but only one of them is happy.

We want all of your patients to be happy, but first, we need data.
More importantly, we need that data not to exist in a vacuum.
